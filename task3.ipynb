      "\n",
      "The site has a good reason to protect its data. For instance, Google Maps doesn’t let you request too many results too quickly.\n",
      "Making many repeated requests to a website’s server may use up bandwidth, slowing down the website for other users and potentially overloading the server such that the website stops responding entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before using your Python skills for web scraping, you should always check your target website’s acceptable use policy to see if accessing the website with automated tools is a violation of its terms of use. Legally, web scraping against the wishes of a website is very much a gray area.\n",

      "In the dark days before you learned Python programming, you had to sit in front of a browser, clicking the Refresh button to reload the page each time you wanted to check if updated content was available.

      "\n",
      "This /dice page simulates a roll of a six-sided die, updating the result each time you refresh the browser. Below, you’ll write a program that repeatedly scrapes the page for a new result.\n",
      "The first thing you need to do is determine which element on the page contains the result of the die roll. Do this now by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting View page source. A little more than halfway down the HTML code is an <h2> tag that looks like this:\n",

      "The text of the <h2> tag might be different for you, but this is the page element you need for scraping the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: For this example, you can easily check that there’s only one element on the page with id=\"result\". Although the id attribute is supposed to be unique, in practice you should always check that the element you’re interested in is uniquely identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now start by writing a simple program that opens the /dice page, scrapes the result, and prints it to the console:\n",

      "This example uses the BeautifulSoup object’s .select() method to find the element with id=result. The string \"#result\", which you pass to .select(), uses the CSS ID selector # to indicate that result is an id value.\n",
      "To periodically get a new result, you’ll need to create a loop that loads the page at each step. So everything below the line browser = mechanicalsoup.Browser() in the above code needs to go in the body of the loop.\n",
      "For this example, you want four rolls of the dice at ten-second intervals. To do that, the last line of your code needs to tell Python to pause running for ten seconds. You can do this with .sleep() from Python’s time module. The .sleep() method takes a single argument that represents the amount of time to sleep in seconds.\n",
      "Here’s an example that illustrates how sleep() works:\n",

      "\n",
      "When you run this code, you’ll see that the \"Done waiting!\" message isn’t displayed until five seconds have passed from when the first print() function was executed.\n",
      "For the die roll example, you’ll need to pass the number 10 to sleep(). Here’s the updated program:\n",
