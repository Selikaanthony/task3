      "\n",
      "The site has a good reason to protect its data. For instance, Google Maps doesn‚Äôt let you request too many results too quickly.\n",
      "Making many repeated requests to a website‚Äôs server may use up bandwidth, slowing down the website for other users and potentially overloading the server such that the website stops responding entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before using your Python skills for web scraping, you should always check your target website‚Äôs acceptable use policy to see if accessing the website with automated tools is a violation of its terms of use. Legally, web scraping against the wishes of a website is very much a gray area.\n",

      "In the dark days before you learned Python programming, you had to sit in front of a browser, clicking the Refresh button to reload the page each time you wanted to check if updated content was available.

      "\n",
      "This /dice page simulates a roll of a six-sided die, updating the result each time you refresh the browser. Below, you‚Äôll write a program that repeatedly scrapes the page for a new result.\n",

      "\n",
      "Note: For this example, you can easily check that there‚Äôs only one element on the page with id=\"result\". Although the id attribute is supposed to be unique, in practice you should always check that the element you‚Äôre interested in is uniquely identified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now start by writing a simple program that opens the /dice page, scrapes the result, and prints it to the console:\n",

      "To periodically get a new result, you‚Äôll need to create a loop that loads the page at each step. So everything below the line browser = mechanicalsoup.Browser() in the above code needs to go in the body of the loop.\n",
      "For this example, you want four rolls of the dice at ten-second intervals. To do that, the last line of your code needs to tell Python to pause running for ten seconds. You can do this with .sleep() from Python‚Äôs time module. The .sleep() method takes a single argument that represents the amount of time to sleep in seconds.\n",
